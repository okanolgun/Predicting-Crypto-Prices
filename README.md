# Predicting-Crypto-Prices
Today I coded a machine learning model that you can predict the price movements of any cryptocurrency you want. In the code page, you first pull the data with the Yahoo API. Then you make the necessary adjustments and insert it into the LSTM machine learning model. As you can see in the last sample images, a prediction window opens and you have a model that you can predict the past and future price movements of the cryptocurrency you want. I wrote the codes as much as I could, explaining them and with sample lines. I hope it can be useful for you.
